# Interstellar_reviews_sentiment_analysis
Did a sentiment analysis on the reviews from IMDB of my favourite movie Intestellar. First I have extracted the data from IMDB website by using Beautiful Soup (bs4). Then converted that data in dataframe format for convinience of post processing of reviews in the model. I have used the pretrained model BERT as my NLP technologyy and feeded it with moviews reviews and got the numerics as a result ranging from 1 to 5. 1 means very and 5 means outstanding.

This was my attempt of creating a project on the topic of NLP, natural language processing. As a result the model gave pretty great accuracy and as a developver at the end of this project I was satisfied. 
In future maybe I will build a interface where the data can be directly feeded by the user and sentiment analysis would be done very easily on the feeded text.
